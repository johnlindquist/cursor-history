Below is a detailed plan outlining how you could add this searchable interface feature to your CLI tool:

---

## Overview

**Goal:**  
Enhance the default behavior so that when the CLI is run without specifying a subcommand, it will:

- **Extract and List Conversations:**  
  Load available conversations from the global storage (using or extending the existing extraction logic) and present them as a list. Use a “name” for each conversation (derived from an existing property like a session title, the first message, or the creation timestamp) to help users identify sessions.

- **Searchable & Interactive Selection:**  
  Present the list with a fuzzy-search or filterable prompt using an NPM library (for example, [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) with a fuzzy search plugin or a dedicated searchable prompt like [inquirer-search-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer-search-list)).

- **Generate Markdown Output:**  
  Once a conversation is selected, convert the conversation to Markdown (using your existing `formatConversation` function), write it to a temporary directory, and display the file path.

- **Clipboard Integration:**  
  Copy the full Markdown content to the clipboard using an NPM library like [clipboardy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboardy).

- **Optional File Opening:**  
  Optionally, offer to open the file immediately using the system’s default editor (leveraging Node’s `child_process` to run an “open” command on macOS or the equivalent on other platforms).

## Detailed Implementation Steps

### 1. **Define the New Default Command**

- **Create/Update Command:**  
  Either add a new default command (e.g., `src/commands/default.ts`) or extend the current behavior in `src/index.ts` so that if no subcommand is provided, the tool will run this interactive session selector.

- **CLI Entry Point:**  
  Modify the Oclif configuration to point the default command to your new interactive session command.

### 2. **Load and Process Conversation Data**

- **Reuse Extraction Logic:**  
  Reuse or extend the `extractGlobalConversations()` function so that instead of immediately writing files, it returns an array of conversation objects.

- **Determine Display Name:**  
  For each conversation, determine a “display name” using one of these strategies:
  - Check for a dedicated session name property.
  - Fallback to a formatted timestamp (`new Date(convo.createdAt).toLocaleString()`).
  - Or, use the first few words of the conversation text.

### 3. **Implement a Searchable Prompt**

- **Library Selection:**  
  Use a library like [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) and enhance it with a search capability. Options include:
  - [inquirer-search-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer-search-list), or
  - Custom filtering logic with the standard list prompt.
  
- **Prompt Details:**  
  Present a list of conversations where each option shows the “display name” along with additional info (e.g., creation date or preview text).

### 4. **Generate Markdown File on Selection**

- **Formatting:**  
  Once a user selects a conversation, call the existing `formatConversation(convo)` to get the Markdown content.

- **Temporary Directory:**  
  Write the Markdown file to a temporary directory. You can use Node’s built-in `os.tmpdir()`:
  
  ```js
  import os from 'os'
  import path from 'path'
  import {writeFileSync} from 'fs'
  
  const tmpDir = os.tmpdir()
  const filename = `conversation-${Date.now()}.md`
  const outputPath = path.join(tmpDir, filename)
  writeFileSync(outputPath, markdownContent)
  ```

### 5. **Clipboard Integration**

- **Library:**  
  Use [clipboardy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clipboardy) to copy the Markdown content.
  
  ```js
  import clipboardy from 'clipboardy'
  await clipboardy.write(markdownContent)
  ```

- **User Feedback:**  
  Notify the user that the content has been copied and display the file location.

### 6. **Optional: Auto-Open File**

- **Platform-Specific Command:**  
  You could optionally invoke the system’s default application to open the file. For example, on macOS:
  
  ```js
  import {exec} from 'child_process'
  exec(`open "${outputPath}"`)
  ```
  
  On other platforms, adapt the command accordingly (e.g., `xdg-open` on Linux or `start` on Windows).

### 7. **Error Handling & Testing**

- **Edge Cases:**  
  - If no conversations are found, display a helpful message.
  - Validate that file writes and clipboard operations succeed.
  
- **Unit Tests:**  
  Write tests for the new command using your existing Oclif test setup. You might simulate user input and verify that the correct file is created and that the clipboard is updated.

### 8. **Documentation & Examples**

- **Update README:**  
  Add documentation and usage examples to your README (or CLI help) that explains how to use this new interactive mode.

- **Example Message:**  
  After processing, the CLI might output something like:
  > “Markdown file created at /tmp/conversation-1634567890.md and copied to clipboard.”

## Library Dependencies

- **inquirer** (and possibly a fuzzy search addon) for the interactive prompt.
- **clipboardy** for copying content to the clipboard.
- **Node’s built-in modules:** `os`, `path`, and `child_process` for temporary directory handling and optionally opening files.

## Summary of Workflow

1. **Run CLI (default command):**  
   Extract conversations from the global database.
   
2. **Display Interactive List:**  
   Present a searchable list using inquirer.

3. **User Selection:**  
   Once a conversation is selected, format it to Markdown.

4. **Generate Markdown File:**  
   Save the Markdown file to a temporary directory.

5. **Clipboard & Output:**  
   Copy the Markdown content to the clipboard and print the file location (optionally auto-open the file).

By following this plan, you can extend your CLI tool to offer an enhanced, user-friendly way to navigate and export conversation sessions.
